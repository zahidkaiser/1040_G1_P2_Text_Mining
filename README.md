The main purpose of the Shiny App is to create a user interface that allows users to analyze the suggested corpus of texts or upload a text document of their own for further analysis. Once the file is uploaded, the application will analyze it and generate a word cloud with the list of most frequently used meaningful words. The application has two interactive controls allowing users to choose the minimum frequency of words as well as the maximum number of words. The word cloud will update automatically to meet the userâ€™s selection(s). This is a quick and easy way to determine and visualise the words most frequently used in the text document that the user uploaded.
